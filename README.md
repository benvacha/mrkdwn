# Website

### Concept
A simple demo page that allows a user to enter *mrkdwn* and view the generated XHTML markup and DOM rendered preview in real time. Includes controls for hiding and showing the various output fields. Includes examples that can be automatically loaded into the *mrkdwn* field.

### In The Wild
Available at [http://mrkdwn.org](http://mrkdwn.org)

### Deploy
The current build makes use of XHTML, CSS, and JS and can be easily deployed to a LAMP server with no special requirements or configurations.
